## Project Overview
This project is an essential part of our SQL course. The objective is to create a relational database that reflects the major learning outcomes from the 8 weeks of SQL course. The project includes core requirements and additional advanced options.

## Dataset
We used the dataset "Most Subscribed YouTube Channels" from Kaggle, which explores YouTube channel information. This dataset includes:
- Channel Names
- Brand Focus (Gaming, Music, etc.)
- Subscriber Base (Millions)
- Primary Languages
- Content Categories (Broad & Specific)
- Country of Origin

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/most-subscribed-youtube-channel?resource=download).

## Project Requirements

### Core Requirements
✔ Create relational DB of your choice with minimum 5 tables  
✔ Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between the tables  
✔ Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way  
✔ In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB  
✔ Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis  
✔ Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown  

### Advanced Options
✔ In your database, create a stored procedure and demonstrate how it runs  
✔ In your database, create a trigger and demonstrate how it runs  
✔ In your database, create an event and demonstrate how it runs  
✔ Create a view that uses at least 3-4 base tables; prepare and demonstrate a query that uses the view to produce a logically arranged result set for analysis  
✔ Prepare an example query with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis

## Submission and Assessment
- A backup copy of the database diagram has been saved as `projectname.sql` and submitted via Slack.
- The project will be restored on the instructor's MySQL server for examination.
- The project will be presented and demonstrated in class during week 8.

## Presentation
This project includes both an online submission and a class presentation. The final assessment was based on the project submission and the presentation in our online classroom.
